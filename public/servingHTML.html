        The third week we learned how to make full use of express, and how to make a CRUDable API. 
        Part of learning how express worked was done by making us create a website from scratch, 
        which had a clock, constantly changing itself to the current time. Having this run on Heroku 
        allowed us to have our first functioning website using node.js.
