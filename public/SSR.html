    <h1>SSR (Server Side Rendering)</h1><br>
    <h5>In our second to last week of coding, we learned about server side rendering, 
        which is where (in our case) the components of our web app is assembled in 
        our API. This means, that instead of having our entire HTML pages built from 
        scratch, we create smaller pieces of our html pages, and put them together 
        server side.</h5>
