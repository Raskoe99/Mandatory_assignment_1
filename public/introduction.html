    <h1>Introduction week and datatypes</h1> <br>
    <h4>During the first week, we especially learned about datatypes, like Let, Const and 
        Var. Our first lesson was: DON'T use Var. The difference especially being, that 
        Var is not blockscoped, meaning that if the variable is redefined in scope, the 
        global variable is also changed, therefore making the variable unstable. Const cannot 
        be redefined in scope, but Let can. However, this is without changing its global 
        variable. We learned about this in node.js, a backend runtime environment for 
        javascript code.</h4>
