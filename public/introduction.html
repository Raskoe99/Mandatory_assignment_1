    <h1>Introduction week and datatypes</h1> <br>
    <h5>During the first week, we especially learned about datatypes, like Let, Const and Var.</h5> <br>
    <h5>Our first lesson was: DON'T use Var. The difference especially being, that Var is not</h5> <br>
    <h5>blockscoped, meaning that if the variable is redefined in scope, the global variable </h5> <br>
    <h5>is also changed, therefore making the variable unstable.</h5> <br>
    <h5>Const cannot be redefined in scope, but Let can. However, this is without changing its </h5> <br>
    <h5>global variable. </h5> <br>
    <h5>We learned about this in node.js, a backend runtime environment for javascript code.</h5>
