        Advanced JS and express
    </h1><br>
    <h4>
        During our second week we learned about advanced JS like hoisting and how to use express. 
        Hoisting is when a declared variable is used before it is initialized, and depending on 
        which datatype is used, we get a different result. Const gives a syntax error, (and the 
        code won't run) and the Let type gives the value "undefined". Var, however, is a global 
        variable, and can therefore be hoisted succesfully. 
        Express is an application framework, that allows us to build an API using javascript. 
        This means that we can create a CRUDable API, with (in our case) beer types, and choose 
        the port we want our app to listen to.
