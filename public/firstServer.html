        Advanced JS and express
    </h1><br>
    <h4>
        During our second week we learned about advanced JS like hoisting and how to use express. 
        Hoisting is when a declared variable is used before it is initialized, and depending on 
        which datatype is used, we get a different result. Const gives a syntax error, (and the 
        code won't run), the Let type gives the value "undefined" and so does Var. 
        Express is an application framework, that allows us to build an API using javascript. 
        This means that we can create a CRUDable API, with (in our case) beer types, and choose 
        the port we want our app to listen to.
