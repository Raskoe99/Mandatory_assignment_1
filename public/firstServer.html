    <h1>Advanced JS and express</h1>
    <h5>During our seconde week we learned about advanced JS like hoisting and how to use express.</h5><br>
    <h5>Hoisting is when a declared variable is used before it is initialized, and depending on </h5><br>
    <h5>which datatype is used, we get a different result. "Const" gives a syntax error, (and the </h5><br>
    <h5>code won't run), the Let type gives the value "undefined" and so does Var. </h5><br>
    <h5>Express is an application framework, that allows us to build an API using javascript.</h5><br>
    <h5>This means that we can create a CRUDable API, with (in our case) beer types, and choose</h5><br>
    <h5>the port we want our app to listen to.</h5><br>
