    <h1>Express & import/export</h1><br>
    <h4>
        In our fifth week, we learned importing and exporting files to our javascript file, 
        how to use imported methods and how to get the attributes of an object without using 
        the dot method like object.attribute (which is called deconstruction). Routers are 
        in charge of switching between different views for the user, an example being 
        changing from a login screen to a "Welcome" screen.
